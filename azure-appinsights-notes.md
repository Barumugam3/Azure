Certainly! To integrate **Azure Monitor Application Insights** with a **Jetty server** in a **Java** application, follow these steps:

1. **Configure Application Insights**:
    - **Connection String**: Obtain your Application Insights resource's connection string from the Azure portal.
        - You can find it in your Application Insights resource settings.
        - Set it using the environment variable `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING` or the Java system property `applicationinsights.connection.string`.
        - Alternatively, specify a file to load the connection string from (e.g., `connection-string-file.txt`).
    - **Cloud Role Name**: Set the cloud role name to label the component on the application map.
        - If not set, the Application Insights resource's name is used.
        - Example: `{ "role": { "name": "my cloud role name" } }`

2. **Configuration File Path** (Optional):
    - By default, Application Insights Java 3.x expects the configuration file to be named `applicationinsights.json`.
    - It should be located in the same directory as `applicationinsights-agent-3.4.19.jar`.
    - You can specify a custom configuration file path using:
        - `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONFIGURATION_FILE` environment variable.
        - `applicationinsights.configuration.file` Java system property.
        - If you specify a relative path, it resolves relative to the directory where `applicationinsights-agent-3.4.19.jar` is located.

3. **Add Java Agent to Jetty Server**:
    - In your Jetty server, add the following JVM argument:
        ```
        -javaagent:path/to/applicationinsights-agent-3.4.19.jar
        ```
    - Save the configuration and restart the Jetty server.

4. **Auto-Instrumentation for Azure App Services** (Optional):
    - If your Java app runs in Azure App Service, you can enable monitoring with one selection:
        - No code changes required.
        - Application Insights Java 3.x is automatically integrated, collecting telemetry.
        - Supported auto-instrumentation scenarios include various environments and languages Â³.

Remember to replace placeholders like `path/to/applicationinsights-agent-3.4.19.jar` and customize the settings according to your specific setup. Happy monitoring! ðŸš€
